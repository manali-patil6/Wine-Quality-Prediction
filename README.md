# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Decodr - Product Research

Inspiration
Use machine learning to determine which physiochemical properties make a wine 'good'!

Fisrt, some EDA is done using matplotlib and seaborn. Then different classifier models are used to predict the quality of the wine.

1. Random Forest Classifier

2. Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier

3. Support Vector Classifier(SVC)

Then, cross validation evaluation technique is used to optimize the model performance.

1. Grid Search CV

2. Cross Validation Score
