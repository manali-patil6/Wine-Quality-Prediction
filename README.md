# Wine-Quality-Prediction

Classification is a process of categorizing a given set of data into classes, It can be performed on both structured or unstructured data. The process starts with predicting the class of given data points. The classes are often referred to as target, label or categories.

##Problem Description : 
<br>
Use machine learning to determine which physiochemical properties make a wine 'good'! 

Fisrt, some EDA is done using matplotlib and seaborn. Then different classifier models are used to predict the quality of the wine.

1. Random Forest Classifier

2. Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier

3. Support Vector Classifier(SVC)

Then, cross validation evaluation technique is used to optimize the model performance.

1. Grid Search CV

2. Cross Validation Score
